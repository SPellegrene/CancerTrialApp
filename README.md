##### Sam Pellegrene

I am a front-end engineer driven to change the world through my passion for technology. I believe putting data into the hands of the consumer is the best way for technology to serve our communities. Life is about those we live amongst anyway, so why not empower each and every one of them?

*Diagnosed* is in full development and aims to help empower patients by providing accurate cancer and testing location information.

The Diagnosed app has dreams of donating profits to assist families struggling to pay for cancer treatments. Hope you enjoy and feel free to contribute yourself, I would love to hear your ideas!
