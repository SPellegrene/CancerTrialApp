##### Sam Pellegrene

I am a front-end engineer driven to change the world through my passion for technology. I believe putting data into the hands of the consumer is the best way for technology to serve our communities. Life is about those we live amongst anyway, so why not empower each and every one of them?

The Diagnosed app is in full development and aims to help empower patients by providing accurate test trial information. I plan on building map rendering functionality, as well as a login/account creation page.

The Diagnosed app has dreams of donating profits to funding cancer research around the world. Hope you enjoy and feel free to contribute yourself, I would love to hear your ideas!
