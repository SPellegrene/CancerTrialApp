###### How it works!
Enter your cancer and let the Diagnosed app find detailed information and doctors who specialize in testing for that specific cancer all around the United States.

###### About
The Diagnosed app is a cancer test trial finding app built for cancer patients seeking a second opinion. Created and developed by [Sam Pellegrene](http://sammypelly.com/). Once a patient enters their cancer, they are given disease information, phone number, address, and name of the Doctor to ensure they have valuable information as quickly as possible.

###### Mission
To provide a simple and stress free way for cancer patients to find a second opinion.

##### Sam Pellegrene

I am a front-end engineer driven to change the world through my passion for technology. I believe putting data into the hands of the consumer is the best way for technology to serve our communities. Life is about those we live amongst anyway, so why not empower each and every one of them?

The Diagnosed app is in full development and aims to help empower patients by providing accurate test trial information. I plan on building map rendering functionality, as well as a login/account creation page.

The Diagnosed app has dreams of donating profits to funding cancer research around the world. Hope you enjoy and feel free to contribute yourself, I would love to hear your ideas!
